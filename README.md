# starting

First step of test and exploration of methods to analyse different kind of curves.
Our goal is to create or use algorithm enabling us to classify or to clusterize EEG for medical purposes. But if we succeed, the goal would be to get that more general and use that kind of approch in different fields.

# IDEAS 
Why not having the same approach than alignement of genomic sequences. We first extract pattern with NN or other tools and then define a certain distance (kind of threshold). This threshold defines if we add the time serie analyzed as a new pattern or if it is similar to one detected before . 

# TODO

+ Search more information about home made / cheap EEG
+ Documentation time series analysis
+ Possible applications
+ Evaluate and compare different approaches
